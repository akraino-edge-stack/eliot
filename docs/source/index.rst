ELIOT is "Enterprise Edge Lightweight and IOT" project under Akraino
approved blueprint family and part of Akraino Edge Stack, which intends
to develop a fully integrated edge network infrastructure and running
edge computing applications on lightweight Edge Nodes. 

ELIOT targets on making the edge node a lightweight software stack which 
can be deployed on edge nodes which have limited hardware capacity by 
leveraging lightweight OS, a container running environment and container 
orchestration applications.
